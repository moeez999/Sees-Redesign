            An airtightness test, also known as an air permeability test or
            blower door test, is a diagnostic procedure used to measure the air
            leakage rate of a building's envelope. During the test, a temporary
            airtight barrier, typically a large fan mounted on an adjustable
            frame, is installed in an external doorway or opening of the
            building. The fan depressurizes or pressurizes the building,
            creating a pressure difference between the inside and outside. By
            measuring the airflow required to maintain this pressure difference,
            the air leakage rate of the building can be quantified.

              Airtightness is a critical factor in the energy performance of
              buildings. Air leakage can account for a significant portion of
              heat loss or gain in a building, leading to increased energy
              consumption for heating and cooling. By identifying and reducing
              air leakage through an airtightness test, buildings can improve
              their energy efficiency and reduce utility costs.

              Air leakage can result in drafts, cold spots, and uneven

              allergens, and outdoor contaminants to enter the indoor
              environment, compromising indoor air quality and occupant comfort.
              By minimizing air leakage through an airtightness test, buildings
              can maintain more consistent indoor temperatures and improve
              indoor air quality.
