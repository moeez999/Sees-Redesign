            An Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) plan is a comprehensive strategy
            developed to assess, manage, and maintain good indoor air quality in
            buildings. IAQ plans are particularly important for ensuring
            occupant health, comfort, and productivity, as people spend a
            significant amount of time indoors, especially in residential,
            commercial, and institutional buildings. An effective IAQ plan aims
            to identify and mitigate sources of indoor air pollution, minimize
            exposure to harmful contaminants, and promote a healthy indoor
            environment.

            An Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) test is a systematic assessment
            conducted to evaluate the quality of indoor air within a building or
            enclosed space. IAQ testing is performed to identify and measure
            levels of various air pollutants, contaminants, and parameters that
            may affect occupant health, comfort, and well-being. The testing
            process typically involves several steps and may vary depending on
            the specific objectives of the assessment and the types of
            pollutants of concern.

              or parameters of concern. Common indoor air pollutants include
              volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, carbon monoxide
              (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter (PM), allergens,
              mold spores, bacteria, and radon. The objectives of the IAQ test

              In many jurisdictions, there are regulations and standards
              governing indoor air quality in buildings to protect occupant
              health and safety. By implementing an IAQ plan and conducting IAQ
              testing, you can ensure compliance with relevant regulations and
              demonstrate due diligence in managing indoor air quality risks.

                Green Building Certifications:
              </strong>{" "}
              Green building certification schemes like BREEAM require buildings
              to meet certain criteria related to indoor air quality as part of
              their assessment process. Having an IAQ plan and conducting IAQ
              testing can help earn credits or points towards achieving
              certification and demonstrate commitment to sustainable building
              practices.

            In summary, while both LCA and WLCA are methodologies used to assess
            environmental impacts, LCA provides a broader assessment covering
            various environmental indicators, whereas WLCA zooms in on carbon
            emissions to evaluate a building or infrastructure project's
            contribution to climate change.
