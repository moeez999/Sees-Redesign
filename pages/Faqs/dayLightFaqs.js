            Daylighting calculations and simulations are techniques used in
            building design and analysis to evaluate the amount and distribution
            of natural daylight within a space. Daylighting is the practice of
            using natural light to illuminate indoor environments, reducing the
            need for artificial lighting and enhancing visual comfort and
            well-being for occupants. Daylighting calculations and simulations
            help architects, engineers, and building designers optimize building
            designs, select appropriate glazing and shading systems, and meet
            daylighting requirements for energy efficiency and occupant comfort.

                Daylight Factor Calculation:
              </strong>
              The daylight factor is a metric used to quantify the amount of
              natural light available in a space relative to the light available
              outside under overcast sky conditions. Daylight factor
              calculations involve assessing factors such as window size,
              orientation, glazing properties, room depth, and surface
              reflectance to estimate the average illuminance level within a
              space. Daylight factor calculations are typically performed using
              mathematical models or software tools that simulate daylight
              penetration and distribution.

            Sunlight analysis, also known as solar access analysis or solar
            exposure analysis, is a process used in architectural and urban
            design to evaluate the availability and distribution of sunlight on
            building sites, outdoor spaces, and surrounding environments. The
            goal of sunlight analysis is to assess the impact of solar radiation
            on building performance, energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and
            outdoor amenity spaces. Sunlight analysis helps architects,

            Daylighting plays a significant role in BREEAM (Building Research
            Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) assessments due to
            its importance in creating sustainable and high-performance
            buildings. Here's why daylighting is essential in the context of
            BREEAM:
