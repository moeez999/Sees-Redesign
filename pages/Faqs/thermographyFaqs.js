            A thermographic survey, also known as a thermal imaging survey or
            thermography inspection, is a non-destructive testing technique used
            to assess the temperature distribution and thermal performance of
            building components, systems, and structures. This survey utilizes
            thermal imaging cameras to detect and visualize infrared radiation
            emitted by objects based on their surface temperature. The resulting
            thermal images, or thermograms, provide valuable insights into the
            thermal condition, energy efficiency, and potential defects within
            buildings.

              <strong className="text-secondary">Survey Preparation:</strong>
              Before conducting the survey, the building and its components are
              prepared to ensure accurate and reliable thermal imaging results.
              This may involve adjusting indoor temperature conditions,
              controlling solar radiation, and removing obstructions or debris
              that may interfere with the imaging process.

              A thermal imaging camera, also known as an infrared camera or
              thermographic camera, is used to capture thermal images of the
              building components and surfaces. The camera is calibrated to
              accurately measure temperature differences and is typically
              equipped with features such as thermal sensitivity, temperature
              range, and image resolution suitable for building inspections.

              During the survey, trained technicians or thermographers
              systematically scan the building interior and exterior surfaces
              using the thermal imaging camera. The camera detects infrared
              radiation emitted by objects, which is converted into thermal
              images displayed on a monitor or screen in real-time. Multiple
              images are captured from different angles and perspectives to
              cover all areas of interest.

                  health. This information helps researchers understand the
                  thermal dynamics of natural environments and evaluate the
                  impacts of climate change.

                  Thermal imaging is used for perimeter security and
                  surveillance applications to detect intruders, trespassers,
                  and wildlife activity in low-light or nighttime conditions.
                  Thermal cameras can detect body heat signatures and movement,
                  enhancing situational awareness and security response
                  capabilities.

            Overall, thermographic surveys have diverse applications across
            industries, including building inspections, industrial maintenance,
            environmental monitoring, and security. By leveraging thermal
            imaging technology, organizations can improve operational
            efficiency, reduce risks, and enhance safety in various applications
            and environments.
