            A thermographic survey, also known as a thermal imaging survey or
            thermography inspection, is a non-destructive testing technique used
            to assess the temperature distribution and thermal performance of
            building components, systems, and structures. This survey utilizes
            thermal imaging cameras to detect and visualize infrared radiation
            emitted by objects based on their surface temperature. The resulting
            thermal images, or thermograms, provide valuable insights into the
            thermal condition, energy efficiency, and potential defects within
            buildings.

              Before conducting the survey, the building and its components are
              prepared to ensure accurate and reliable thermal imaging results.
              This may involve adjusting indoor temperature conditions,
              controlling solar radiation, and removing obstructions or debris
              that may interfere with the imaging process.

            <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
              A thermal imaging camera, also known as an infrared camera or
              thermographic camera, is used to capture thermal images of the
              building components and surfaces. The camera is calibrated to
              accurately measure temperature differences and is typically
              equipped with features such as thermal sensitivity, temperature
              range, and image resolution suitable for building inspections.

              using the thermal imaging camera. The camera detects infrared
              radiation emitted by objects, which is converted into thermal
              images displayed on a monitor or screen in real-time. Multiple
              images are captured from different angles and perspectives to
              cover all areas of interest.

                  Thermal imaging is utilized for wildlife surveys and
                  ecological studies to detect and monitor animal populations,
                  behavior patterns, and habitat use. Thermal cameras can detect
                  animals based on their body heat signatures, even in low-light

                  Thermal imaging is employed for environmental research and
                  monitoring applications, such as studying heat exchange
                  processes, mapping thermal gradients, and assessing ecosystem
                  health. This information helps researchers understand the
                  thermal dynamics of natural environments and evaluate the
                  impacts of climate change.
