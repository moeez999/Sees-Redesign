            U-values, also known as thermal transmittance or thermal
            conductivity, are a measure of how effectively a material conducts
            heat. Specifically, U-values indicate the rate of heat transfer

            difference between the indoor and outdoor environments.

              Buildings with lower U-values typically require less energy for

              SBEM calculations can also be used to assess the impact of various
              energy efficiency measures or building design changes on the
              building's overall energy performance. This helps designers and
              builders identify opportunities to improve energy efficiency and
              meet regulatory requirements.

            To demonstrate compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations in
            the United Kingdom using SBEM (Simplified Building Energy Model)
            calculations, you typically follow these steps:

              Collect detailed information about the building's design,

              size, orientation, construction materials, insulation levels,

              If the SBEM calculation indicates that the building does not meet
              the compliance targets, identify areas where energy efficiency
              improvements can be made. This may involve upgrading insulation,
              improving glazing, optimizing heating and cooling systems,
              installing energy-efficient lighting, or incorporating renewable
              energy technologies.
