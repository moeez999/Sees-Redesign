            Thermal bridging refers to a phenomenon in building construction
            where a material or component with higher thermal conductivity
            creates a pathway for heat to flow more readily than the surrounding
            materials. This results in localized heat loss or gain, which can
            lead to decreased energy efficiency, increased energy consumption,
            and potential comfort issues within a building.

            In simpler terms, thermal bridging occurs when there is a break or
            interruption in the insulation layer of a building assembly,
            allowing heat to bypass the insulation and transfer between the
            interior and exterior environments more easily. This can occur at
            various points within a building's envelope, including:

            Thermal bridges are typically calculated using thermal modeling
            software or hand calculations based on established principles of
            heat transfer. The calculation process involves determining the heat
            flow through the thermal bridge and quantifying its impact on the
            overall thermal performance of the building envelope. Here's a
