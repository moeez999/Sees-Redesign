            BREEAM stands for Building Research Establishment Environmental
            Assessment Method. It's a widely used environmental assessment
            method for buildings and infrastructure projects. Developed by the
            Building Research Establishment (BRE) in the United Kingdom, BREEAM
            provides a framework for assessing and rating the environmental
            performance of buildings across various criteria including energy
            usage, water consumption, materials selection, waste management,
            pollution, and ecology.

            BREEAM is a comprehensive assessment method that evaluates the
            sustainability of buildings and infrastructure projects across a
            range of categories. These categories typically include management,
            energy, health and well-being, transport, water, materials, waste,
            land use and ecology, and pollution.

            Buildings assessed under BREEAM can achieve different levels of
            certification based on their performance. These certification levels
            typically include Pass, Good, Very Good, Excellent, and Outstanding,
            with Outstanding being the highest level of sustainability
            performance.

            BREEAM offers several different schemes tailored to specific types
            of buildings and projects. Here are some of the key schemes
            available:

            A BREEAM Bespoke assessment refers to a customized or tailored
            assessment within the BREEAM framework that is designed to meet the
            specific sustainability goals and requirements of a particular
            building or project. While BREEAM offers standard assessment schemes
            for various types of buildings and developments, there may be cases
            where a project has unique characteristics or sustainability
            objectives that are not fully addressed by the standard schemes.

            Difference between BREEAM AP and Assessor

            The roles of BREEAM AP (Accredited Professional) and BREEAM Assessor
            are distinct within the BREEAM certification process, each serving
            different purposes. Here's a breakdown of their differences:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl ">
              BREEAM Assessor: Conducts the assessment of a building or project
              against the BREEAM criteria.
            </li>
            <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl ">
              BREEAM AP (Accredited Professional): Provides strategic and
              technical advice to project teams throughout the design,
              construction, and operations phases of a building project.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2
            data-aos="fade-right"
            className="text-2xl text-secondary font-bold mt-8 mb-4"

            How much does a BREEAM Assessment cost?
          </h2>
          <p
            data-aos="fade-up"
            className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl "
          >
            The cost of a BREEAM assessment can vary significantly depending on
            several factors such as the type and size of the project, the
            complexity of the building or development, the level of
            certification targeted, the location, and the services provided by
            the BREEAM assessor or consultancy.
          </p>
          <p
            data-aos="fade-up"
            className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl "
          >
            As a rough estimate, the cost of a BREEAM assessment typically
            ranges from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars or
            pounds. Larger and more complex projects with ambitious
            sustainability goals may require more extensive assessment
            processes, additional documentation, and higher levels of
            consultancy involvement, leading to higher costs.
          </p>
          <p
            data-aos="fade-up"
            className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl "
          >
            It's essential for project stakeholders to obtain detailed quotes
            and proposals from BREEAM assessors or consultancies to understand
            the specific costs involved in conducting a BREEAM assessment for
            their project. Additionally, it's worth considering the long-term
            benefits and potential cost savings associated with achieving a
            higher level of sustainability certification through BREEAM.
