            A Building User Guide is a document provided to occupants or users
            of a building that contains essential information about the
            building's design, construction, operation, maintenance, and safety
            features. The purpose of a Building User Guide is to help occupants
            understand how to use and maintain the building effectively, promote
            occupant comfort and safety, and ensure the efficient operation of
            building systems and equipment. Here are the typical components
            included in a Building User Guide:

            In the context of BREEAM (Building Research Establishment
            Environmental Assessment Method), a Building User Guide refers to a
            document that provides occupants or users of a building with
            information on how to operate, maintain, and interact with the
            building in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner.
            The Building User Guide is one of the requirements under BREEAM
            assessments to achieve credits related to user education and
            engagement. Here's what a Building User Guide in BREEAM typically
            consists of:
