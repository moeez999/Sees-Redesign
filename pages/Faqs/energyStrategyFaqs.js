          </h2>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl my-4">
            A Low Zero Carbon Report is an energy strategy that provides a
            comprehensive plan or framework developed by organizations,
            governments, or entities to systematically reduce carbon emissions
            and energy consumption while promoting sustainability, resilience,
            and economic competitiveness. It outlines specific actions,
            policies, and initiatives aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon,
            energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable energy system.
