          19. What are SBEM Calculations?
        </h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl ">
          SBEM (Simplified Building Energy Model) calculations are a method used
          in the United Kingdom to assess and rate the energy performance of
          non-domestic buildings. SBEM calculations are required to demonstrate
          compliance with building regulations and obtain a Building Regulation
          Compliance Certificate for new non-domestic buildings and certain
          renovations or extensions.

              Energy Performance Assessment:
            </strong>
            SBEM calculations evaluate the energy performance of a non-domestic
            building based on various factors such as the building's fabric,
            heating systems, cooling systems, ventilation, lighting, and
            renewable energy sources.

            The output of SBEM calculations is an energy performance rating
            expressed as a numerical value in kilowatt-hours per square meter
            per year (kWh/mÂ²/year). This rating represents the predicted energy
            consumption of the building for heating, cooling, ventilation,
            lighting, and hot water production.

          To demonstrate compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations in
          the United Kingdom using SBEM (Simplified Building Energy Model)
          calculations, you typically follow these steps:
