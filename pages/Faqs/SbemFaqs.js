          19. What are SBEM Calculations?
        </h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl ">
          SBEM (Simplified Building Energy Model) calculations are a method used
          in the United Kingdom to assess and rate the energy performance of
          non-domestic buildings. SBEM calculations are required to demonstrate
          compliance with building regulations and obtain a Building Regulation
          Compliance Certificate for new non-domestic buildings and certain
          renovations or extensions.

            Energy Performance Assessment
          </h2>
          <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            SBEM calculations evaluate the energy performance of a non-domestic
            building based on various factors such as the building's fabric,
            heating systems, cooling systems, ventilation, lighting, and
            renewable energy sources.
          </li>
          <h2 class="text-2xl text-secondary font-bold mb-2"> Data Input</h2>

          <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            The calculations require detailed input data about the building's
            characteristics, including its size, orientation, construction
            materials, insulation levels, glazing types, heating and cooling
            systems, lighting efficiency, and renewable energy technologies.

          <h2 class="text-2xl text-secondary font-bold mb-2">SBEM Software</h2>
          <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            SBEM calculations are typically performed using approved software
            tools that implement the SBEM methodology. These software tools
            facilitate the input of building data and perform the necessary
            calculations to determine the building's energy performance.

            Energy Performance Rating
          </h2>
          <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            The output of SBEM calculations is an energy performance rating
            expressed as a numerical value in kilowatt-hours per square meter
            per year (kWh/mÂ²/year). This rating represents the predicted energy
            consumption of the building for heating, cooling, ventilation,
            lighting, and hot water production.

          <h2 class="text-2xl text-secondary font-bold mb-2">Compliance</h2>

          <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            In the UK, non-domestic buildings must achieve a minimum level of
            energy performance to comply with building regulations. The required
            energy performance rating varies depending on factors such as the
            building's type, size, and use, as well as changes to building
            regulations over time.

          </h2>
          <li className="text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            SBEM calculations can also be used to assess the impact of various
            energy efficiency measures or building design changes on the
            building's overall energy performance. This helps designers and
            builders identify opportunities to improve energy efficiency and
            meet regulatory requirements.
