                Sadler Energy and Environmental Services Ltd was founded in 2008
                with our teamâ€™s background firmly in the construction industry,
                initially specialising in energy calculations and Code for
                Sustainable Homes reports. Over the years, we have evolved and
                broadened our services in response to changing building
                regulations and advancements in building physics.

                Our journey began modestly, operating from a home's box room. As
                demand grew, we transitioned to an office space and gradually
                built a dedicated team. Today, we take pride in offering a
                comprehensive array of services, including thermal modelling,
                overheating analysis, commercial air testing, passive house air
                testing, and environmental statements. Our commitment to
                sustainability is deeply ingrained in our business ethos, with
                our team serving as the cornerstone of our operations. We
                prioritise the well-being of both our team and clients, ensuring
                that we consistently deliver optimal outcomes.

                Our dedication to environmental stewardship extends throughout
                our business practices, making a positive impact on the
                environment, community, and business landscape. We have
                developed and implemented an environmental management plan that
                emphasises recycling and prioritises sustainable products, even
                down to our choice of toilet paper, which reflects our
                commitment to zero carbon impact. Additionally, we have taken
                proactive steps to reduce our carbon footprint and encourage our
                clients and educate others to empower them to make positive
                environmental impacts.

                As part of our community engagement efforts, we have hosted Cub
                Scouts to educate them about environmental responsibility and
                everyone's role in fostering positive change. We recognise the
                vital role our staff plays in our sustainability endeavours,
                considering them integral to both our company and our commitment
                to environmental responsibility. Our staff embodies the essence
                of SEES, not merely as employees but as champions of
                sustainability.
